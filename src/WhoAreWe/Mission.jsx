            Our mission is to provide timely and comprehensive information, to everyone, 
            wherever they are. We shall report the facts as they are, while reflecting a 
            wide variety of views to keep them informed and help them shape an opinion. 
            We shall provide a forum for the public to discuss issues of importance and 
            interest. We believe that knowledge and information form the foundation of 
            social equality and shall work diligently to connect to the younger generation.
